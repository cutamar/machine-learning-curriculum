# machine-learning-curriculum
This is my personal curriculum for learning abot ML. Additionally, I will add summaries for all MOOCs and books I finish. 
I don't warrant the correctness and completeness of the notes. If you spot an error, feel free to create a PR. 
The notes will be written using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), because it allows me the usage of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) notation.  
Most of the curriculum is based on [this blog post](https://learningai.io/projects/2017/03/26/machine-learn-MOOC-curriculum.html).
I propose doing it in the order listed below:

- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) + [A Mind for Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU) - I highly recommend this MOOC as a starting 
point for self paced learning (the book is optional)
- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - will give you a first overview on ML
- [Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python) -
if you feel proficient using python, you can skip this one
- There are three ways for this one:
  - [Calculus 1A: Differentiation](https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1a-differentiation-mitx-18-01-1x-0) + 
  [Calculus 1B: Integration](https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1b-integration-mitx-18-01-2x-0)
  - [Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/) + 
  [Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)
  - or do all four of them (it all depends on how deep you want to dive into mathematics)
- [Introduction to Probability](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2) - probability, a must for ML
- [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) - one of the best Linear Algebra MOOCs available online
- There are three ways for this one:
  - [Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)
  - [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/)
  - or both of them
- [Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html) - contains interesting practical assignments
- There are three ways for this one:
  - [Learning from Data](https://www.edx.org/course/learning-data-introductory-machine-caltechx-cs1156x-0)
  - [Machine Learning](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229) - big brother of Professor Ngâ€™s Coursera course
  - or both of them, for the very eager learners
- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738?keywords=pattern+recognition+and+machine+learning&qid=1538121819&sr=8-1&ref=sr_1_1) -
this one is optional
- [Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCiZc0n6COY&list=PLruBu5BI5n4aFpG32iMbdWoRVAA-Vcso6) + 
[accompanying text](http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) - set yourself apart from the crowd
- [Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks) +
[Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) - you need to invent side projects, to get the most out of it 
- [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models) - take it with the *"Honors"* option
